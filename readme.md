# Event Simulation - M/M/1 Queue Model

Codes are for programming homework of Mathematical Modeling in BUAA Computer School.

Implements: 

- M/M/1 single queue & single window model.
- M/M/n single queue & multi windows model. (just add more than one service class) 
- Visualization analysis of **mean wait+service time**, **window average usage by time**, **queue average length by time**, **fail waiting rate by time**.
